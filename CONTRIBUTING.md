## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Flask Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep functions small and focused

```python
def process_image(image_data: str) -> dict:
    """
    Process base64 image and return prediction results.
    
    Args:
        image_data: Base64 encoded image string
        
    Returns:
        dict: Prediction result with landmarks
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript (Frontend)
- Use camelCase for variables
- Use const/let instead of var
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions pure when possible

```javascript
/**
 * Normalize Arabic character variants for image lookup
 * @param {string} char - Arabic character to normalize
 * @returns {string} Normalized character
 */
function normalizeChar(char) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### HTML/CSS
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow RTL-first design for Arabic
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use semantic HTML tags
